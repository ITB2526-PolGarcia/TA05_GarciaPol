## 📱 Mobile Adaptation

The site uses advanced **CSS Media Queries** to ensure a seamless experience on mobile devices.

* **Mobile (< 768px):** Elements stack vertically for easy scrolling.
* **Tablet (< 1024px):** Optimized grid layouts and adjusted image scaling.
* **Images:** All media utilizes `max-width: 100%` to prevent layout breaking on small screens.
